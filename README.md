# Dr.-Kane-research-data-generator
this project is aimed to automatic the process of obtaining a formula for quadric equation's solution number, it is quite complicated, so i am still working on it
To generate all the cases and its excel files you have to:
  1. run the "generate all the cases.py" file which will generate number of solution database for all the cases(alternatively just download all the txt files)
  2. run the integrated version and input the value of N you want, all the other stuff will be done by your computer

needed modules:
1. openpyxl
